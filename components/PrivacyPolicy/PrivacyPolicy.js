                    <li>
                    When you use ScanTheDoc, we collect certain information to provide 
                    and improve our services. This includes personal details such as 
                    your name, email address, and login credentials, which are required 
                    to create and manage your account. Additionally, we collect 
                    invoice-related data when you upload documents through our platform. 
                    These files may contain invoice numbers, vendor details, transaction amounts, 
                    and other financial data, which are processed using OCR and AI 
                    technologies to extract relevant information.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    We also collect automated data such as your IP address, device type, 
                    browser details, and usage patterns to improve user experience and 
                    optimize system performance. This data helps us analyze traffic, 
                    detect fraudulent activities, and enhance security measures.
                    </li>
                  </ol>

                    Although we take strong precautions, no system can be completely

                    credentials confidential and report any suspicious activity immediately. 
                    ScanTheDoc is not responsible for security breaches resulting 
                    from user negligence or weak password management.
